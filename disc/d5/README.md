## About this assignment

Although we don't have an in-class discussion today, this discussion activity serves as replacement work for the missed discussion this week (9/27/19). This assignment will count towards your discussion grade, and you should submit it to the submit server by the above deadline. You must complete all of the exercises in the `src/disc.ml` file WITHOUT USING THE `rec` KEYWORD. We have provided the `map`, `foldl` and `foldr` functions from last week's discussion, and you can (and should) use these functions in your `src/disc.ml` implementations.

The assignment is written to help you prepare for the quiz next week. The following topics are fair game for the quiz:

  * Functions
  * Lists
  * Tuples
  * let statements
  * Higher Order Functions
  * Data Types

We recommend looking through the topics covered in this discussion activity as well as past quizzes, which can be found on the [course webpage](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc330/#exams).

If you have questions, make sure you ask us on Piazza! We're going to be as active as we can be this weekend so that we can help guide you guys through this activity.
